# TrackitIT-PortGuard

**Current Version: 1.0.6**

## In Nutshell
This is a simple TCP Gateway or proxy with advanced security features.
The mechanism similar to port knocking, however much more safe and also very user fiendly. 
This software act as TCP Server Daemon which accepting connections, and when new connection made the software decide to forward or drop regarding the atuhentication.

Connection being tunneled if source IP Address is KNOWN as Trusted. There are a many configurable and various ways to check this: Å±
 - DNS Query
 - Flatfile Based 
 - HTTP Query
 - Built-In Webserver 
 - Our eneterprise-class trackit-2019 monitoring instance

The software has built-in Flood, Denial Of Service detection and protection. 
The software hard to be exploited due it is running on Low-Level Virtual Machine like framework with the speed of pure C/C++. 
Also the software does not requires privileges at all. The software works on local machine as well remote machines.

From 1.0.4 version there is an ability to turn unsecured traffic into TLS and an ability to forward unathenticated sources too


## Introduction
This is a personal project from the author of nPulse.net, Viktor Hlavaji (DaVieS).
nPulse.net is always willing to share knowledge and resources with others, and I have 10+ experience of making industry-class / enterprise-class softwares.

A daily attacks / not including mailing / increased by 250% since 2020. Protecting the services like VNC, RDP, SMB, NFS, SSH protocols are recommended however sometimes tricky. 
My goal is to supply quality products that proving no need for over-complicated network to make it safe.
